# Golang Boilerplate

This is a small starter project for a Golang server system backed by an SQLite
database. This is meant for single-process programming, meaning that your server
runs in a single process, on a single machine, in a single availibility zone.
I bet that this system will probably get you pretty far, or at least far enough
until you can hire some smart people to build the system "right".
